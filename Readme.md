# BreadChrombs

BreadChrombs is a Chrome extension that attempts to intelligently 
manage your browser history and the state of your tabs when you close 
them and draw conclusions that make it simple to close your tabs, knowing 
full-well that you'll always be able to retrace your steps.

## installation

To install, simply download the repo (or a personal fork of it if you'd
also like to make changes) and then load it as an "unpacked extension"
from chrome's [extensions page](chrome://extensions). You will need
to turn on "Developer mode" on the same page to see this option.

In the future, the extension will be packed and available to download.
If that is the case, you will need to 'manually' drag and drop the
`.crx` file into the "extensions page".

To further simplify the installation process, this extension will become
available on the webstore once it is finished or in late-beta.
